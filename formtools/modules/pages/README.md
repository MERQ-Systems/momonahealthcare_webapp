## Pages module

The Pages module lets you create custom pages to embed within the Form Tools UI, containing whatever information you want. A common usage for this module is to provide some sort of custom "Splash" screen for client accounts when they log in, which contains simple help information.


### Notes

- Pages 2.0.0 and later support Form Tools 3. Anything prior to that only works with Form Tools 2.x. 
- The current version will NOT work with the Submission Accounts module. This should be updated when the Submission
Accounts module is updated for FT3 support.
